        <h1>Hexelo Low Assurance Signing Policy</h1>
        <p>
            Signing certificates are used to verify the identity of the subject of the certificate.
        </p>
        <p>
            Low assurance signing certificates can be issued and renewed upon successful authentication to Active Directory.
            Low assurance signing certificates may be manually enrolled or renewed and may also be autoenrolled and autorenewed through Active Directory Group Policy mechanisms.
            The subject of the certificate is identified by their knowledge of the account’s user name and password combination. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The certificate and related private key are stored on the hard disk in the user’s profile. 
            The certificate may only be used for signing purposes and cannot be archived for private key recovery. 
            Signing certificates do not allow export of the private key.
        </p>
